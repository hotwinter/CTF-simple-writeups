# In Hex, No One Can Hear You Complain

* Problem:

  While flying through the outskirts of the Ripley system, you notice a distress signal from one of the outer moons. It appears a ship has crash-landed near a 16-sided pyramid. The lone survivor, a docx file, tells you that a malicious programmer has embedded an egg in his chest and he's afraid that it's going to hatch. He offers his assistance if you can help find the egg.

* Solution:

  We open the .docx file, in there it says there is a hidden image in this file. Also zipped is highlighted. Hence we get the idea to open .docx as a zip file(The header 50 4B 03 04 also suggested zip for the first two bytes) In ubuntu, we can use archive manager to open it, locate to media, and we found the key.png
