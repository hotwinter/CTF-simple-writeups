# Failure to Boot

* Problem:

  After opening the robot's front panel and looking inside, you discover a small red button behind a tangle of wires. Pressing the button lights up the robot's primary screen. It glows black and quickly flashes blue. A line of small text types out:

  `ERROR: 0x00000023
  The text refreshes and displays the prompt:
  FILE SYSTEM RECOVERY INITIATED...
  FILE SYSTEM COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED...
  PLEASE ENTER FILE SYSTEM FORMAT:`

* Solution:

  google ERROR: 0x00000023 gives FAT_FILE_SYSTEM

* Answer:

  FAT
