# CFG to C

* Problem:

  Wouldn't it be cool to be able to have one of these patrol drones to do your bidding?! Figure out the correct sequence of C functions from the following control flow graphs and you should be well on your way.
Submit the correct order of functions.

* Solution:

  Checking the flow graph, 
first one contains sub, therefore should be B
second one contains cmp, therefore should be C
third one contains add, therefore should be D
fourth one does not have any condition, therefore A
(This is just simple reasoning, not very thorough)

* Answer:

  BCDA
