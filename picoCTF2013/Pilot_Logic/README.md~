Pilot Logic

Problem:
You've gotten a partial dump of the disk from the hangar's machine, and you're pretty sure the pilot's password is cleverly hidden somewhere within it...
The disk image can be found on the shell machines at /problems/pilot_logic.img and the contents of the image are available in /problems/pilot_logic/

Solution:
ssh into the shell for the game
go to /problems/pilot_logic/
cd into home/pilotbot
ls -a in the directory to show hidden directory
cd .secret
cat key

Answer:
You can't take the sky from me
