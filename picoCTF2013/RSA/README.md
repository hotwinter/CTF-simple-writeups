# RSA

* Problem:
  
  Math is cool! Use the RSA algorithm to decode the secret message, c, p, q, and e are parameters for the RSA algorithm. Problem

* Solution:

  To handle large numbers easily, we use python. Following the [RSA description](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29), we can write a python script to decrypt it.

NOTE `pow(a, b, c)` can computer a**b % c very fast!
