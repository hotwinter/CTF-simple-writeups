========================================================================

1. Failure to Boot:
google ERROR: 0x00000023 gives FAT_FILE_SYSTEM, hence the answer is FAT

2. Read the Manual:
Caesar decode using tr [a-zA-Z] [e-za-dE-ZA-D] < tmpUsFRu3.txt
gives the answer miuwcaxmpeti

3. Technician Challenge
Google the question gives Nissan 350Z

4. XMLOL
Download XML File and open it with text editor give the key
137523296076621846197481818748

5. Grep is Your Friend
Download the file, and write a bash script 

tar tf grep.tar | while read -r FILE
do
    if tar xf grep.tar $FILE  -O | grep "SECRET AUTH CODE" ;then
        echo "found pattern in : $FILE"
    fi
done

This gives the answer "fHYYpdrfeOCHyQicfe96xfw=="

6. First Contact
Viewing on Cloudshark The longest length one gives

NEW LOCATI
ON COORDINATES: 
37 14'06"N 115 4
8'40"W..NEW LOCA
TION INFO: LOCKE
D..NEW LOCATION 
UPDATE COMPLETE

Hence the answer is 3714'06"N 11548'40"W

7. Try Them All!
Writing a python script and compute the hashcode for all words in /usr/share/dict/words + salt with function in hashlib gives the answer
approving

8. GETKey
Change the query admin=false&competition=ccdc
to admin=true&competition=picoCTF
gives the flag
9fa449c061d64f58de600dfacaa6bd5d

9. Spaceport Map
Since it's a gif file, executing 
convert spaceportmap.gif out%d.pgm
and check out3.pgm reveals the key: 
Do passports let you fly interstellar?

10. Bitwise
modify the python script, iteration over each element in verify_arr
since elements are char, iterate over 0,256 and compute (((i << 5) | (i >> 3)) ^ 111) & 255 check when it matches the element in verify_arr, gives the flag:
ub3rs3cr3t

11. Yummy
Checking the source code reveals <!-- DEBUG: Expected Cookie: "authorization=administrator"
use the console and run
document.cookie="authorization=administrator"
refresh the page 
and do what the instruction says gives the key
DX7-2 or DX9-5 or DX4-9 or DX6-7 (This is 4 keys, any of them works)

12. CFG to C
Checking the flow graph, 
first one contains sub, therefore should be B
second one contains cmp, therefore should be C
third one contains add, therefore should be D
fourth one does not have any condition, therefore A
Hence the key is BCDA
